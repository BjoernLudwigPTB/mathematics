# Mathematics

The idea behind this repository is to try out different sorts of algorithms, experiment with plotting some of the data and testing or simply executing the code in a meaning full way. Until we explicitly say so in this README.md, we probably do not provide something useful to anybody else than us in this repository.

Still, if you stumble across something that appears useful to you, get in touch with us and let us know.
